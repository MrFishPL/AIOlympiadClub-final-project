# Important information:

- The version of this task without ViT is quite simple and enjoyable, you can start with it
- The version with ViT requires the use of its weights in a significant way. You can modify the architecture, add more layers, etc., as long as the weights are actually used
- The model solution for the variant with ViT does not score 100 points, but maybe you can squeeze that much out of it?
- To run the notebook, upload it to Google Colab. The necessary libraries should be installed there. The dataset is downloaded automatically.
