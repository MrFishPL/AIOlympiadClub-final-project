The tasks were prepared by **Bartosz Trojan** and **Michał Karp** as part of the preparations for the AI Olympics final. We encourage you to solve them on your own. Good luck!

The folders contain the files and instructions needed to run the notebooks. The folders also contain solutions prepared by the authors.

The author of **“Brother, train your segmentation”** and **“They have returned”** is *Michał Karp*, and the author of **“Poor Representations”** and **“Pizza Time”** is *Bartosz Trojan*.
