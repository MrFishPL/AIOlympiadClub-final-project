# Important information:

- The `easier.ipynb` version includes instructions on how to use the model. The `harder.ipynb` version does not include such instructions and requires more work with the documentation
- Embeddings were created from sentences before masking
- The `data1.json` and `data2.json` datasets contain two different languages so that you can make sure your solution is not tailored to a specific language. The `SECRET.json` test dataset is also in a different language
- To start the notebook, upload it along with your data sets to Google Colab. Libraries that are not available in the default environment must be installed by running the appropriate cells
- The `SECRET.json` dataset is a test dataset. Using it completes the task; further refinement of the task after receiving the result on this dataset is pointless
